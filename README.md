about: | 
  As a Site Reliability Engineer, I'm responsible for ensuring that systems are available, reliable, and performant. I work closely with
  development teams to identify and resolve issues before they impact the final users, and I'm always looking for ways to improve
  infrastructure and processes. In my free time, I code for the DevOps world and I enjoy exploring new technologies and tools.
