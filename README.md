about: | 
    As a Site Reliability Engineer, I am accountable for guaranteeing the accessibility, dependability, and performance of our systems. 
    Collaborating closely with development teams, I actively seek to identify and address any issues before they can affect end-users. I am 
    constantly on the lookout for opportunities to optimize infrastructure and refine processes. In my leisure time, I engage in coding for 
    the DevOps sphere and remain curious about emerging technologies and tools.
